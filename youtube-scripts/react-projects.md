# Best React Projects For Each Level

### Brainstorming

Creating a unique and rare selection of projects with commentary on what needs to accomplished with each.

- Unique Prjects
- One project for each level
- Little info on each project.

### Levels

1. Beginner - Note Taking
2. Intermediate - Google Chrome Homepage
3. Advanced - Social Media Dashboard

### Video Structure

- Mention how this video is for which level
- Emphasize on how you selected the projects
- Adress the target audience
- Go straight to the description of each project, with
  - What tech. used
  - Visual examples
  - examples from github repos
  - Examples on youtube.

## Intro

- Might have... adress target(completed a course, looking for portfolio projects - set apart)
- I have carefully selected 3 courses (1 for each level)
- Begin, inter, adv
- unique, set you apart from your competition
- Without waste time, First project
- No it's not a todo list app,

## Beginner Project

**Note Taking App**

- I rather suggest a note taking application,
- with a tags feature
- Features: Basic Text field for new note, and a list of all the notes, like a dashboard
- Tags feature optional
  - Programatically detecting any tags in the note, and then making them clickable, so as soon as you click the tag
  - The list of notes update to only show the notes with the tag
  - able to close the tag and get back to all the notes.
  - Leaning more towards an intermediate feature, but definitely give it a go before giving up.

## Intermediate Project

**Homepage And Widget**

- At intermediate level, we have Homepage and widget manager
- If you go to your browser settings, set a custom url for a new tab.
- Now what if you were able to build a browser homepage, where users can 
    - add bookmarks to frequently visited sites
    - add weather widgets to their location
    - type in a url to get redirected to a google search with what was entered 
- Very easy implement
    - API for weather
    - State management with localstorage for bookmarks
    - Parsing the input into a google search query, and believe it is easier than it sounds
- Why in intermediate? Actually useful and sounds complex for a portfolio project.
- If you are watching this video after 1 month from it's upload, I have probably uploaded a video of me building this project using react/nextjs.

## Advanced Project

**Social Media Dashboard**
- Every web app developer, or app developer, eventually makes some kind of a dashboard.
- The user should be able to
    - Upload content using the web app, preferably to multiple social media accounts at once. 
    - view analytics of different accounts, views, likes, comments
    - (optional, over the top) view suggestions based on top performing videos 
- You should be able to accomplish this by 
    - using the YouTube API, Instagram and Facebook (meta api), twitter (paid)
    - Use chat gpt in the backend to get suggestions, based on good performing content.

**BTW, stay tuned for my video on browser homepage project, bye**
