## Intro

- Might have... adress target(completed a course, looking for portfolio projects - set apart)
- I have carefully selected 3 courses (1 for each level)
- Begin, inter, adv
- unique, set you apart from your competition
- Without waste time, First project
- No it's not a todo list app,

## Beginner Project

**Note Taking App**
- I rather suggest a note taking application, 
- with a tags feature
- Features: Basic Text field for new note, and a list of all the notes, like a dashboard
- Tags feature optional
  - Programatically detecting any tags in the note, and then making them clickable, so as soon as you click the tag
  - The list of notes update to only show the notes with the tag
  - able to close the tag and get back to all the notes. 
  - Leaning more towards an intermediate feature, but definitely give it a go before giving up. 

## Intermediate Project

**Homepage And Widget**
- At intermediate level, we have Homepage and widget manager


## Advanced Project

**Social Media Dashboard**
