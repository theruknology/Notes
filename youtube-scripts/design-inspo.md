- I use on a daily basis
- Straight to point

## Matter

5. **Lapa Ninja**

- Practical landing pages of active businesses.
- Solid production websites built by great web designers.
- No amatuer creators, only solid designs
- One of the first websites i discovered for inspiration

4. **Dribble.com**

- Actually a freelance site for web designers.
- Inspiration section
- All sorts of designs from mobile to web
- I don't use this much: because there are other websites wit better organization

3. **AWWWards.com**

- Awwwards website is exactly what the name suggests
- It has a SOTD,
- Nominees section
- One thing about this website is: All the designs are way too extravagant, loads of RAM usage
- Good portfolios and show off.

2. **Pinterest**

- I use the most
- I don't think I need to introduce pinterest, because it is already a giant in Art inspiration
- If you didn't know, due to being used globally by millions, it has highest amount of designs,
- But the selling point isn't the quantity, it's the creation of boards. Let me explain
- Explain workflow

1. **Behance**

- Created and maintaned by Adobe
- Nothing new about this site,
- Just very professional designs and great content on this site.
- And usually the designs posted are accompanied by "Design Documentation", like the color scheme, fonts, margins and development process.

#### If you are a decent web developer, I have a request:

Please go ahead and make an adobe account on Behance, (or Piterest if you like)
Just go ahead and post 1 of your designs, that you are the most proud of, not only does it help fellow designers like me, but also boosts your confidence, and gives you some presentation skills.

I am recommending behance, because it is widely used for portfolios. You can make an account post a few designs and send your account link to whoever you want to show.
